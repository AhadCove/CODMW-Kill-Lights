# Call Of Duty Modern Warfare Kill Lights

### Installation
Make sure you have openCV, PIL, and numpy  installed

After that head to util.py and replace the request with whatever light or api you want to call when you get a kill

### Troubleshooting
If your kills are not registering it may have something to do with your screen resolution. You'll want to grab a template that will fit your screen resolution, so just take a recording of your kill in COD. Then take a screenshot of that recording and crop it to only show the kill sign. Name that template.png and place it in this folder
